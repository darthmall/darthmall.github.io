At Spotify I design data visualizations and tools for Spotify's data that are used to inform product design and business and decisions. The projects I've worked on have ranged from dashboards with robust filtering capabilities that profile groups of users in terms of demographics, behavior, and taste, to complex visualizations of how users navigate the Spotify client.
