This is a tool for data scientists, product owners, and designers to explore how users on Spotify navigate the clients to find something to stream. It provides both a high level summary of how many streams can be attributed to any page because it was one step on a path through the client that resulted in a stream, and a detailed view of steps taken by users to reach a stream.
