I am curently a Designer for [Spotify](https://spotify.com)'s Data Mission,
having been acqui-hired when Spotify purchased
[Seed Scientific](http://seedscientific.com), where I was a Design Technologist.

At Spotify, as at Seed, I design and build visualizations and applications for
data analysis. Previously I was IT Coordinator for the
[National Museum of Mathematics](http://momath.org/), and before that a User
Experience Designer at [Schr√∂dinger, Inc.](http://schrodinger.com/) where I
designed and tested user interfaces used by computational chemists in the
pharmaceutical industry to design drugs.

I also have extensive software development experience, primarily for the web
using Python and JavaScript. My development experience has focused primarily on
user interface development and data visualization.

In 2012 I received my Masters of Human-Computer Interaction from the
[Human-Computer Interaction Institute](http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/masters-program-pittsburgh)
at Carnegie Mellon University.
