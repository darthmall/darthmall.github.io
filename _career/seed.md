I designed and built data visualization tools for our clients. While there, I implemented the first version of [UNICEF](unicef)'s [transparency portal](iati) and I designed and built the user interface for a [data management and reporting application]({% link ../_projects/polio.md %}) for their Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
