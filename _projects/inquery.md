As part of my Masters degree in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) I led a team of
four students on a seven month long capstone project. Our project was sponsored
by [M\*Modal][mmodal], a Pittsburgh-based company that produces dictation
software for physicians. Our objective was to design feedback mechanisms for use
in conjunction with M\*Modal's dictation software that helps physicians improve
the quality of their documentation.

The Masters in HCI focuses on the user-centered design process exemplified by
our capstone project. During the spring semester, we conducted interviews and
contextual inquiries with physicians to better understand their needs and
constraints when inputting patient data. Over the summer we began exploring
possible solutions based on what we had learned during the spring semester. We
began by imagining as many solutions as we were able and then through a process
of testing our designs, we refined our ideas down to a single solution presented
to our client at the end of the summer.

More detail about the project itself is available from the
[project website][inquery].
