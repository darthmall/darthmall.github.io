title: "InQuery: Documentation Assistant"
---

As part of my Masters degree in Human-Computer Interaction I led a team of four students on a seven month long capstone project. Our project was sponsored by M*Modal, a Pittsburgh-based company that produces dictation software for physicians. Our objective was to design feedback mechanisms for use in conjunction with M*Modal's dictation software that helps physicians improve the quality of their documentation.

## User Research

During the spring semester, we conducted interviews and contextual inquiries with physicians to better understand their needs and constraints when inputting patient data.
