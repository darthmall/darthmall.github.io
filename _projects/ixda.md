Along with two other designers at Spotify, I designed and built software for Spotify’s Interaction Design Association (IxDA) 2018 conference booth. Using [Spotify’s public API](https://developer.spotify.com/), we presented users with a small fact about their listening habits that corresponded to pins that they could take with them as a memento of the conference. There was a different theme for each day: day one was your favorite genres based on your top artists; day two was how upbeat your favorite music is; day three was how danceable your favorite music is. We worked with a graphic design agency to create the visual style for the booth and prepare a different backdrop and pins to create a coherent experience at the booth.

We built the application using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), [svelte](https://svelte.technology/), and [D3](https://d3js.org/).
