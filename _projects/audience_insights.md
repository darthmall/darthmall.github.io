Audience Insights is a tool I designed for internal use at Spotify that provided access to aggregated information about Spotify’s users to marketers, product owners, data scientists, _etc._ at Spotify. It offers a graphical interface for specifying one or more audiences so that knowledge of SQL wasn’t required to access this information, and then it allows the user to choose which dimensions of their audiences they want to visualize.
