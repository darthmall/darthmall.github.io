## The Global Polio Eradication Initiative

[UNICEF](unicef) is one of the five core partners in the
[Global Polio Eradication Initiative](gpei) (GPEI) working to eradicate polio from the
three remaining countries in which it is endemic.

At Seed Scientific I worked with UNICEF to design and develop a tool for
tracking the key indicators they use to monitor their efforts in Nigeria, one of
the three endemic countries (along with Pakistan and Afghanistan).

## Background

The GPEI runs regular campaigns to vaccinate children in endemic countries. They
track over 30 indicators to monitor these campaigns. These indicators are
communicated to the head of UNICEF's polio initiative for each country as a
printed single page report of data visualizations. At the time, these reports
were generated by manually entering the data into a spreadsheet template after
each campaign.

Seed was asked to design and build a web application to replace the manual
process UNICEF was using to generate these reports. I designed a dashboard that
functioned both as part of an interactive application, but could also be printed
for meeting handouts. As part of a small team at Seed, I built this dashboard as
part of an application that also included a custom dashboard builder and data
entry and upload features.

## User Research

We spent a week in Nigeria with the UNICEF team there learning about their
operation both in their office in Abuja as well as in the field. We traveled
north to Sokoto to meet with Social Mobilizers in several towns. The Social
Mobilizers are locals that work for UNICEF to educate people about polio
vaccinations and other important health issues.
